They were the last people you\u2019d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn\u2019t hold with such nonsense","Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.","The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn\u2019t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley\u2019s sister, but they hadn\u2019t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn\u2019t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn\u2019t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.","When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.","None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and    tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum andthrowing his cereal at the walls","Little tyke, chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four\u2019s drive. It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar \u2014 a catreading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn\u2019t realize what he had seen \u2014 then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn\u2019t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive \u2014 no, looking at the sign; cats couldn\u2019t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.","But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\u2019t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\u2019t bear people who dressed in funny clothes \u2014 the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion.  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren\u2019t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt \u2014these people were obviously collecting for something\u2026 yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.","Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn\u2019t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn\u2019t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\u2019d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.","He\u2019d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker\u2019s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn\u2019t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn\u2019t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.","He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking\u2026 no, he was beingstupid. Potter wasn\u2019t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn\u2019t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He\u2019d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn\u2019t blame her \u2014 if he\u2019d had a sister like that\u2026 but all the same, those people in cloaks\u2026","Sorry,\u201d he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn\u2019t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!","Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn\u2019t approve of imagination","As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw\u2014and it didn\u2019t improve his mood \u2014 was the tabby cat he\u2019d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.","The cat didn\u2019t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife","Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door\u2019s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\u201cWon\u2019t!\u201d). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:","\u201cAnd finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\u2019s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\u201d The newscaster allowed himself a grin. \u201cMost mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\u201d \u201cWell, Ted,\u201d said the weatherman, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, but it\u2019s not only the owls that havebeen acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\u2019ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early \u2014 it\u2019s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\u201d","Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters\u2026","Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He\u2019d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \u201cEr \u2014 Petunia, dear \u2014 you haven\u2019t heard from your sister lately, have you?\u201d","As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn\u2019t have a sister. \u201cNo,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cFunny stuff on the news,\u201d Mr. Dursley mumbled. \u201cOwls\u2026 shooting stars\u2026 and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today\u2026\u201d \u201cSo?\u201d snapped Mrs. Dursley. \u201cWell, I just thought\u2026 maybe\u2026 it was something to do with\u2026 you know\u2026 her crowd.\u201d","Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\u2019d heard the name \u201cPotter.\u201d He decided he didn\u2019t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \u201cTheir son \u2014 he\u2019d be about Dudley\u2019s age now, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d"][e]))},D=function(e){for(var t=e.counter,a=new Array,n=0;n<t;n++)a[n]=n;return r.a.createElement(r.a.Fragment,null,a.map((function(e){return r.a.createElement(k,{key:e})})))},E=function(e){function t(){return Object(l.a)(this,t),Object(u.a)(this,Object(c.a)(t).apply(this,arguments))}return Object(m.a)(t,e),Object(d.a)(t,[{key:"render",value:function(){return r.a.createElement("section",{style:{marginTop:"150px"}},this.props.showResult?r.a.createElement(D,{counter:this.props.counter}):null)}}]),t}(n.Component),M=Object(i.b)((function(e){return{counter:e.counter,showResult:e.showResult}}))(E),_=function(e){function t(){return Object(l.a)(this,t),Object(u.a)(this,Object(c.a)(t).apply(this,arguments))}return Object(m.a)(t,e),Object(d.a)(t,[{key:"render",value:function(){return r.a.createElement("section",null,r.a.createElement(p,null),r.a.createElement(v,null),r.a.createElement(M,null))}}]),t}(n.Component),j=function(){return r.a.createElement(r.a.Fragment,null,r.a.createElement("section",null,r.a.createElement("a",{href:"http://instagram.com/hrithik.codes"},r.a.createElement("div",{style:{position:"fixed",right:"10px",top:"10px",color:"#f4f5f5",zIndex:"21",textDecoration:"underline"}},"Ritik Chauhan"))),r.a.createElement(_,null))},O=a(15),H={counter:0,showResult:!1},T=function(){var e=arguments.length>0&&void 0!==arguments[0]?arguments[0]:H,t=arguments.length>1?arguments[1]:void 0;return"POST_NUMBER"===t.type?Object(O.a)({},e,{counter:t.val}):"RECEIVE_RESULT"===t.type?Object(O.a)({},e,{showResult:!0}):e},x=Object(h.b)(T);var I=function(){return r.a.createElement(i.a,{store:x},r.a.createElement(j,null))};s.a.render(r.a.createElement(I,null),document.getElementById("root"))},8:function(e,t,a){e.exports={Background:"Carousel_Background__2HOXu",BackgroundDiv:"Carousel_BackgroundDiv__2Ff8I",Div2:"Carousel_Div2__3sOLe",FrontDiv:"Carousel_FrontDiv__1Z_JT",Front:"Carousel_Front__2PZ_e",heartbeat:"Carousel_heartbeat__3bVbE",input:"Carousel_input__26CsY",movingBorder:"Carousel_movingBorder__2vvoW",mobilePosition:"Carousel_mobilePosition__vE7lg"}}},[[19,1,2]]]);
